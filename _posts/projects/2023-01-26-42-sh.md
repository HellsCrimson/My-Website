42sh is a POSIX Shell written in C as part of the curiculum of EPITA (a french engineering school). It is a group project of 4 people.

As it is part of the curriculum, the code is not public. But it works as a real shell, with pipes, redirections, and all the other features you can expect from a shell. While following the POSIX standard, we also implemented some bash features, like the `!!` command, or the `&&` and `||` operators.
