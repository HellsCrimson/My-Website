As the name implies, this is the game Wordle made in Java. This was part of my semester at Oxford Brookes. The game is composed of two part, the command line version and the GUI version. And they both respect the MVC design pattern.  
It is available for download in the <a href="https://github.com/HellsCrimson/Wordle" target="_blank">Github Repo</a> with a Makefile to make launching it easy.
