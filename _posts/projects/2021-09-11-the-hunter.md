The Hunter is a game made with Unity as a project for my second semester. It is composed of two game modes. First a prop hunt in multiplayer that uses Photon for the server. And there is also a single player zombie survival.   

We were a group of 4 and I made the setup of the multiplayer, the game logic for transformation and waves in the survival. I also made 3D objects such as the weapons and most of the object that you can transform into. Also I made the <a href="https://www.projectthehunter.tk" target="_blank">website</a> from a bootstrap.

It is available to download on the <a href="https://github.com/HellsCrimson/TheHunter" target="_blank">Github Repo</a> with an installer. As we used one paid asset, free for student, the full repo isn't publicly available.
