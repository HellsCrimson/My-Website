The Hunter is a game made with Unity as a project for my second semester. It is composed of two game modes. First a prop hunt in multiplayer that uses Photon for the server. And there is also a single player zombie survival.   
It was made by group of 4 and is available to download on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/HellsCrimson/TheHunter)
