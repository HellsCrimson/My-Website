This is a Discord bot to guess when something is going to happen. It is written in NodeJS with a sqlite database to save scores and do a leaderboard. The project is available either on my <a href="https://github.com/HellsCrimson/Time-Prediction-Bot" target="_blank">Github Repo</a> or on my <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/hellscrimson/timeprediction" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>
