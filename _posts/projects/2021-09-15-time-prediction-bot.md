This is a Discord bot to guess when something is going to happen. It is written in NodeJS with a sqlite database to save scores and do a leaderboard. The project is available either on my [Github Repo](https://github.com/HellsCrimson/Time-Prediction-Bot) or on my [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hellscrimson/timeprediction)
