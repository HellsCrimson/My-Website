Benkyō is a quiz app to check the knowledge about Hiragana, Katakana and some Kanji. It is made with Flutter and is my first app that I made.

Here are some of the main screen. There is the main menu where you answer the quizz, the historic of your aswers and the statistics about every kana and kanji that you answered.

|Main|Historic|Stats|
|---|---|---|

It is available on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/HellsCrimson/Benkyo), but you will need to compile it yourself.  
Especialy for iOS, as I don't have a paid developper account.
