This is a project made for my second hackathon, the Oxford Hack. We made it in a day but infortunatly we didn't won in our category.  
It uses blockchain to tie with the storage of official document and sharing them when needed.
It is composed of a C# backend API, that I made, some React for the begining of the frontend and Solidity for the blockchain aspect. As always the project is available on my <a href="https://github.com/HellsCrimson/AuthGov" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
