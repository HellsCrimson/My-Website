This is the project that was made at my first Hackathon made by GottaGoHack. We were a team of 3 students and won it.  
It is a website like Ebay for farmer to sell products that are not sellable in supermarket because of their size or other visual abnormalities.  
The project is a frontend made in Angular and a backend in NodeJS. It also uses Google Distance Matrix to calculate the distance to the seller.  
The project is available on my <a href="https://github.com/HellsCrimson/LaidsFruitsEtLegumes" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>
