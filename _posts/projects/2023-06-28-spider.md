Spider is an HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy written in C++ as part of the curiculum of EPITA (a french engineering school). It is a group project of 4 people. It is a reverse proxy, meaning it can be used to load balance requests between multiple servers, or to serve multiple websites on the same IP address.

As it is part of the curriculum, the code is not public. But it works as a real reverse proxy, with HTTP and HTTPS support, and load balancing between multiple servers. It also supports multiple websites on the same IP address, and can be configured to serve different websites depending on the domain name.

It is written in C++, using Boost ASIO for the networking part, and OpenSSL for the HTTPS support.
There was no use of Boost Beast.

Among the load balancing algorithms implemented, there is a round robin, failover, and fail-robin.
