This is a work in progress. It will be a combination of an API for the backend and a frontend in Angular. It uses the NodeJS wrapper for the r6 API, which is currently broken.  
The <a href="https://github.com/HellsCrimson/R6Stats-frontend" target="_blank">Frontend</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HellsCrimson/R6Stats-backend" target="_blank">Backend</a> are both on my Github as always.
