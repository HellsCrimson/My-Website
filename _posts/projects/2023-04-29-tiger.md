Tiger is a frontend compiler for the Tiger language, written in C++ as part of the curiculum of EPITA (a french engineering school). It is a group project of 4 people.

As it is part of the curriculum, the code is not public, [but the subject is](https://assignments.lrde.epita.fr/). But it works as a real compiler, with a lexer, a parser, etc.

It is written in C++, using Flex and Bison for the lexer and parser, and LLVM for the code generation.

The Tiger language supports basic types (int, string, array, etc.), functions, and classes.
